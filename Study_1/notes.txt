Synchronous tasks: This involves waiting time.
Asyncronous: This does not involve waiting. 

NodeJS works on a single thread. Tis means you can only do one task at a time. If there's any task that is wasting time move it to the Call Stack.

Diffence between Browser JS and NodeJS.

1) Browser has DOM but NOde does not have it. 
2) Browser has Window but Node does not have window elements or objects.
3) Browser has Interactive Apps and the Node has Server Side Apps.
4) Browser need no FileSystem while Node needs a FileSystem(Code is pladed on some directory).
5) Most browsers nowasyas work on latest ES6 Modules wile the Node supports regular JS Modules.

What is the Event Loop? Continuously calling the call stack to see if there's any function to be executed.

* NodeJS can be asynchronous and has non-blocking I/O.
* Killer Feature of NodeJS that made it that successful.
* NodeJs runs on a signle thread.
* There's one thing happening at a time.
